Title: Simulation of Longitudinal Data
Description: Simulation and visualization of complex
    models for longitudinal data. The models are encoded using the model coding
    language 'Mlxtran', automatically converted into C++ codes, compiled on the
    fly and linked to R using the 'Rcpp' package. That allows one to implement
    very easily complex ODE-based models and complex statistical models,
    including mixed effects models, for continuous, count, categorical, and
    time-to-event data.
